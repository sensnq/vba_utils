Planning how things will/should work
Class for pandas functionality (need a name)
	To initialize in VBA, it has to be done like:
		Obj = New ThisClass
		Obj.Initialize(args, ...)
	We can implement multiple ways of initializing, like:
		Class.InitFromXL:	Load from excel file (by name)
		Class.InitFromCSV:	Load from csv (by name)
		Class.InitFromSheet:	Load from a sheet object
	You should be able to output an instance to the same formats
	An instance can have two main parts, header and data
		Header
			At the most basic, access header with array index
			May be able to do dict-like access as well
		Data
			Access by row/col index
			Access by col string/row string
